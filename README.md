# C++20 solutions to Advent of Code 2023 #

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) using C++20.

You can use the (very basic) CMake project to build the solutions, or just cd to a directory and use the command line if you prefer. The solutions should work with GCC 13 and Clang 17, and may or may not compile with MSVC.

Libraries used (in the `extern` directory):

 * [Flux](http://github.com/tcbrindle/flux)
 * [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
 * [CTRE](https://github.com/hanickadot/compile-time-regular-expressions)
